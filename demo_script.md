**Video Length:** 60 seconds

---

### **Part 1: The Problem & The Hook (0-10 seconds)**

**Visuals:**
*   Start with a dynamic, fast-paced montage of Super Bowl clips.
*   Show text on screen: "How do you make THIS..."
*   Transition to showing clips of Chinese cities, culture, and then people looking at their phones.
*   Show text on screen: "...feel like THIS?"

**Narration (You, Qihong):**
"The Super Bowl is a massive cultural event, but how do we make it resonate with a global audience, like millions of fans in China? Our project, 'Blueprint Supreme,' bridges that gap."

### **Part 2: The Demo (10-45 seconds)**

**Visuals:**
*   (10-15s) Show the "Blueprint Supreme" web application, clean and ready.
*   (15-25s) Show a real Super Bowl highlight clip playing in a small window on the screen (e.g., a famous touchdown pass).
*   (25-35s) As you narrate, your mouse moves to the app's input box. You type a description of the highlight you just saw (e.g., "Mahomes throws a last-minute, 50-yard touchdown pass to win the game").
*   (35-45s) Click "Generate Verse." The new, bilingual rap verse appears. Zoom in on the generated text so the judges can read it.

**Narration (You, Qihong):**
"Our app takes any Super Bowl highlight as a simple text input. We then use the power of Google's Gemini API...

...to instantly generate a unique, bilingual Chinese rap verse in the epic style of 'Blueprint Supreme' (大展鸿图).

It's not just a translation; it's a cultural transformation of the moment's energy and glory."

### **Part 3: The Impact & The Vision (45-60 seconds)**

**Visuals:**
*   Show the web app again, perhaps with another generated verse on screen.
*   Showcase the GitHub repository to prove it's real and open-source.
*   End with a final, bold title card: **Blueprint Supreme - The Super Bowl, Reimagined.**

**Narration (You, Qihong):**
"This creates a powerful new way for Chinese fans to connect with the game, making every highlight shareable and culturally exciting. 'Blueprint Supreme' isn't just an app; it's a new blueprint for global fan engagement. Thank you."
